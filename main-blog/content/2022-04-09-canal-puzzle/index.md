> I made this puzzle a year ago. I wanted to release it after I've verified the uniqueness of the solution, but I couldn't afford the time to do so. I'd appreciate it if anyone can verify the uniqueness.
>
> UPD: George Sicherman and Symen Wórld independently analyzed this puzzle and confirmed that the solution is unique. I really appreciate it!

> (If anyone's interested in getting a hint or manufacturing a physical version, please DM me!)
